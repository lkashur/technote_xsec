\section{$\nu_{\mu}$ CC $\pi^{0}$ Selection}
\label{sec:selection}


\subsection{Signal Definition}
The $\nu_{\mu}$ CC $\pi^{0}$ signal definition encompasses charged-current neutrino interactions occuring within the fiducial volume of the detector and containing
\begin{itemize}
    \item exactly one primary muon
    \item exactly zero charged pions
    \item exactly one neutral pion
    \item any number of particles that are not muons or pions.
\end{itemize}
This signal definition applies to final state particles, or particles exiting the target nucleus post-final state interactions (FSI).  The fiducial volume requirement applies to the neutrino interaction vertex, which must be 25 cm from detector boundaries in the drift and vertical directions, 30 cm from the upstream detector face, and 50 cm from the downstream face.

Additional requirements are placed on the signal definition to ensure tracking thresholds are met and selection purity and efficiency are optimized.  These are referred to as phase space constraints and include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p_{\mu} \ge 226$ MeV/c
    \item $p_{\pi^{0}} \ge 100$ MeV/c.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selection Cuts}
When selecting $\nu_{\mu}$ CC $\pi^{0}$ interactions, cuts are made on various reconstructed outputs to narrow the list of candidate interactions.  Included are cuts on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Fiducial volume}: Reconstructed vertex is required to be inside fiducial volume (defined in signal definition).
    \item \underline{Topology}: Interaction contains exactly one primary muon, zero primary charged pions, and two or three primary photons as reported by the machine-learning reconstruction chain's primary particle classification and particle identification algorithms.  Particles also meet phase space requirements of the signal definition.  In the case of three photons, the pair of photons with reconstructed invariant mass closest to $m_{\pi^{0}}$ is chosen to represent the neutral pion candidate.
    \item \underline{Neutral pion mass}: Invariant diphoton mass $<$ 400 MeV in order to reject $\eta$ mesons.
    \item \underline{Flash time}: Interaction is associated with an optical flash that is in-time with BNB beam gate, as determined by the OpT0Finder algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selection Performance}
Selection performance is assessed using the BNB $\nu$ + Cosmic MC sample and off-beam BNB Run 2 data.  The metrics that have been evaulated are efficiency - the fraction of true signal interactions that are matched to selected interactions, and purity - the fraction of selected interactions that are matched to true signal interactions.  Figure \ref{fig:efficiency_momentum} shows the selection efficiency for $\nu_{\mu}$ CC $\pi^{0}$ events before muon and neutral pion momentum thresholds are applied.  The sharp drop-offs at 226 MeV/c and 100 MeV/c for the muon and neutral pion distributions, respectively, motivate the phase space constraints of the signal definition.

Overall, the selection acheives an efficiency of 80\% and a purity of 80\%.  Efficiency and purity for each selection cut are shown in Table \ref{Tab:pureff}.  Signal inefficicies are further characterized in the confusion matrix shown in Figure \ref{fig:efficiency_confusion}, while the backgrounds that lead to impurities are seen in Section \ref{subsec:vars}.

\subsection{Variables of Interest}
\label{subsec:vars}
In this section, the kinematic observables used in the single differential cross section measurement are discussed.  Included are the momenta of the final state muon and neutral pion, as well as the angles these particles make with the NuMI beam.  An additional variable, the invariant diphoton mass, is examined as it serves as a useful standard candle in the calibration of the electromagnetic shower energy scale.  First, however, the methods used to estimate the energy (and momentum) of the reconstructed particles of interest is detailed.

\subsubsection{Energy Reconstruction}
To estimate the momentum of the reconstructed muon, it is first necessary to reconstruct its energy, for which a ``best estimate" approach is taken.  For muons contained within the active detector volume, momentum is calculated using the Continous Slowing Down Approximation (CSDA) that relates a particle's kinetic energy to its range in a material.  For momentum estimation of exiting muons, the degree of multiple coulomb scattering (MCS) along the track is instead used.  Figure \ref{fig:muon_energy} shows how each muon momentum estimate compares with true muon momentum in simulation.

\end{figure}

Unlike muons, neutral pions do not directly ionize the detector medium.  The neutral pion momentum must therefore be inferred from the electromagnetic showers instigated by the photons it decays to.  Shower energy (and momentum) is estimated calorimetrically by summing charge depositions belonging to the shower and accounting for various detector effects:
\begin{equation}
    E_{shower} = W_{i} [\frac{MeV}{e^{-}}] \cdot C_{cal} [\frac{e^{-}}{ADC}] \cdot C_{adj} \cdot \frac{1}{R} \cdot \sum_{dep} e^{\frac{t_{drift}}{\tau}} \cdot dep [ADC],
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}[label=]
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
    \item $W_{i}$ is the work function for argon
    \item $C_{cal}$ converts charge units from ADC to electrons
    \item $C_{adj}$ accounts for missing energy due to subthreshold charge and clustering effects in reconstruction
    \item $R$ is the recombination factor
    \item $\tau$ is the electron lifetime
    \item $dep$ is charge in units of ADC.
\end{itemize}
As the signal definition for this analysis does not require showers to be contained, an additional correction factor is needed to correct for missing energy in exiting showers.  A study for deriving this factor is ongoing with results expected soon.
